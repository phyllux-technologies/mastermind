# Meta-Improvement — Improving the Improvement Process

**Purpose:** The process that improves the process that improves the process.

---

## Principle
> Improving how we improve yields more than improving any single output.

---

## What to Improve
1. **Clarity** — Is the process understandable?
2. **Completeness** — Are there gaps?
3. **Friction** — What makes improvement hard?
4. **Feedback** — Do we know when improvement worked?
5. **Recursion** — Can the process improve itself?
6. **Continuous Learning** — Does the system learn from everything the user shares? Does it explain implications (positive and negative) comprehensively? See `core/processes/continuous_learning_insight.md`.

---

## Triggers
- "Improve the improvement process"
- "Improve the system" (may include this)
- Repeated failure to improve
- New pattern that should be codified
- Continuous Learning process: runs in tandem; improves itself and the process of improving

---

## Anti-Patterns
- **Infinite recursion** — Keep 4 levels max.
- **Process bloat** — Simpler is better.
- **Abstract without action** — Every insight → concrete change.
