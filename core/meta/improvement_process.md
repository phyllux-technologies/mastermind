## Level 2a: Improve the System (mastermind, core)
When you say "improve the system":
1. Read mastermind.md, this file.
2. Identify gaps, friction, missing triggers. 5W1H.
3. Improve mastermind, core structure, project links.
4. **Cross-pollination** — If you run both modular MASTERMIND and a workspace-native coordination system, see core/meta/cross_pollination.md. Compare both; add safe improvements. Run every now and then.
5. Document in core/CHANGELOG.md.
6. Totality check.
