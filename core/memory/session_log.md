## 2026-02-12 — ROOT, Future Vision, Backcast, C: Cleanup

### What We Did
- Created ROOT/ — main coordination hub
- Moved 165+ images from C: (Cursor cache) to ROOT/images/ — frees ~0.85 GB
- Wrote 01_ULTIMATE_SUCCESS_STATE.md — destination point for backcasting
- Wrote 02_BACKCAST_ROADMAP.md — from success back to present
- Wrote 03_IMPLEMENTATION_SEQUENCE.md — execute forward
- Wrote 04_FUTURE_PRODUCTS_AND_CONCEPTS.md — emergent inventions
- MASTERMIND integration: Main Memory updated, MASTERMIND_CROSSREF, MASTERMIND_LINK in ROOT
- C_DRIVE_CLEANUP.md + move-images-from-c.ps1 script

### Epiphanies Gained
- Backcast from success: envision destination, work backwards, interpolate, execute forward
- ROOT = one place for cross-project work. Images, docs, ideas, future. D: drive.
- C: cleanup: delete Cursor assets after verify ROOT. Run script after future image generations.

### Artifacts Created/Modified
- ROOT/: README, structure, docs/future/, docs/strategy/, ideas/, images/, scripts/
- mastermind/core/memory/main_memory.md: ROOT idea, backcast epiphany
- session_log: this entry

## Example — Ecosystem Build

### What We Did
- Created ecosystem strategy, Governor safety system, sellable modules catalog (Quantonics, MoQ, Zettelkasten, BASB, GTD, Bergson, Polanyi, ENGENICA, Lexical Chain)
- Generated images: hero, architecture, workflows, benefits, module marketing, counter-narrative (12 from systems critique)
- Lessons from systems critique: 12 counter-narrative images for trust, dissent counteraction, public product image
- Values section in README; FAQ "Is MASTERMIND controlling?"; Best Practice #15 voluntary participation

### Epiphanies Gained
- Systems can do their worst (pawns, drones, dehumanization) — MASTERMIND counters with agency, transparency, voluntary, human-first
- Counter-narrative images distill dissent and address skepticism before it compounds
- ENGENICA and Lexical Chain as premium modules create ecosystem coherence

### Artifacts Created/Modified
- docs/ecosystem/: strategy, Governor, image plan, sellable modules, scrutiny prompt, lessons from systems critique
- assets/: hero, modules, counter-narrative images
- README: Values, ecosystem link
- 09_FAQ: "Is MASTERMIND controlling?"; 06_BEST_PRACTICES: #15
