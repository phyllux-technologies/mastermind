# Main Memory — Canonical Store

**Purpose:** The single canonical store for ideas, epiphanies, lessons learned, insights, and all memory that informs improvement. Every new idea is added here; the Improvement Propagation Process runs on each addition.

**Related:** epiphanies.md, session_log.md, by_topic/ — Main Memory is primary; others support it.

---

## How to Use

1. **Add** new ideas, epiphanies, lessons, insights to the appropriate section (or **New / Unprocessed** if unsure). *Or use `mm add "idea"` from CLI.*
2. **Run** the Improvement Propagation Process — `core/processes/improvement_propagation.md` — every time something is added. *Or run `mm propagate` for a guided run.*
3. **Mark** entries as processed when the propagation run is complete; move from New to the right section.
4. **Reference** this file when evaluating improvements.

## New / Unprocessed

*Ideas here have NOT yet been run through Improvement Propagation. Run the process after adding.*

## Ideas

*Ideas that could improve projects or the system.*

| Date | Idea | Projects Affected | Status |
|------|------|-------------------|--------|
| 2026-02-12 | ROOT created as main coordination hub (workspace/ROOT). Images moved from C: to D: to free space. Future vision + backcast (01_ULTIMATE_SUCCESS_STATE, 02_BACKCAST_ROADMAP). MASTERMIND integrated. | MASTERMIND, Phyllux, ROOT, All | Done |
| 2026-02-12 | Reality Architect APEX: Ultimate complete state (Phyllux global, 50+ patents, BOOKWURM scale, personal flourishing). TRAIL reverse-engineered Year 10→0. CRITICAL PATH extracted (patent Jan 7 2027, revenue, capital efficiency). SEGMENT 1 built. ROOT/docs/future/REALITY_ARCHITECT/. | Phyllux, ROOT, BOOKWURM, All | Done |
| 2026-02-12 | ROOT iteration 2: IMAGE_CATALOG, VALUES_ALIGNMENT_CHECK, DECISION_LOG, WEEKLY_REVIEW_TEMPLATE, seed-ideas, ONBOARDING, 888/projects/ROOT.md, 04_FUTURE expanded. Cross-links updated. | ROOT, 888, All | Done |

## Epiphanies

*Sudden realizations that change understanding. Often high-leverage.*

- **5W1H alignment** — Who, What, When, Where, Why, How. Aligns tasks, goals, instructions.
- **Improvement process is recursive** — Instructions that tell AI to improve when asked create virtuous loops.
- **Totality check** — Brief pass before finishing: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?
- **Meta improves the base** — Improving the process yields more than improving a single output.
- **Documents are memory** — For AI without persistent memory, files *are* the memory.
- **Externalized memory is shared memory** — Writing to a file makes it readable by next session, human, future tools.
- **Coordination engine enables coordination** — A system designed for coordination makes it possible.
- **Gaps are inventions** — When you walk the chain, missing pieces appear. You discover them.
- **Systems can do their worst** — From critique of oppressive systems: pawns, drones, manufactured ignorance, dehumanization, suppression. MASTERMIND counters: agency, transparency, voluntary, human-first, question welcome, free to leave. Counter-narrative images for public product image. See 05_LESSONS_FROM_SYSTEMS_CRITIQUE.md.

## Lessons Learned

*Concrete lessons from experience. Apply and propagate.*

- **Path safety** — Reject `..`, `/`, `\` in filenames. Never trust user-provided paths.
- **404 over 500** — Return 404 for nonexistent resources instead of raising.
- **Document the change** — Every improvement goes in CHANGELOG. Traceability matters.
- **Preserve unless asked** — Keep existing behavior unless user explicitly requests change.
- **Archive as safety net** — Moving instead of deleting enables bold simplification.

---

## Insights

*Observations that inform decisions.*

- **Structured output unlocks chains** — Machine-readable output lets the next tool consume. Prose is a bottleneck.
- **Virtuous loops** — Each improved component improves the other. Loops can be self-improving.
- **Quality as coherence** — Goal isn't "more" but "coherent."
- **Interlinked AND separate** — Projects share mission but remain distinct. Each has its own master; all reference the engine.
- **Backcast from success** — Envision ultimate success state. Work backwards to present. Interpolate steps. Execute forward. ROOT/docs/future/.
- **Reality Architect** — APEX (ultimate state) → TRAIL (Year 10→0) → CRITICAL PATH (non-negotiable) → SEGMENT builds. Patent Jan 7 2027 immovable.
- **Restart points** — When stuck: QUICK_REFERENCE, ONBOARDING, EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY, WHEN_STUCK. One place. Clear path.
