# Epiphanies — Consolidated Learnings

**Purpose:** Persistent memory for AI and human. Add; rarely delete.

---

## From Instructions & Process Design

- **5W1H alignment** — Who, What, When, Where, Why, How. When uncertain, ask all six.
- **Improvement process is recursive** — Instructions that tell AI to improve when asked create virtuous loops.
- **Totality check** — Brief pass before finishing. Aligns work to mission.
- **Meta improves the base** — Improving the process often yields more than improving a single output.
- **Project brain pattern** — master.md (or equivalent) as single source of truth. Read first, then execute.
- **Document the change** — Every improvement goes in CHANGELOG. Traceability matters.
- **Preserve unless asked** — Keep existing behavior unless user explicitly requests change.

## From Coordination & Systems

- **Documents are memory** — For AI without persistent memory, files *are* the memory.
- **Externalized memory is shared memory** — Writing to a file makes it readable by next session, human, future tools.
- **Coordination engine enables coordination** — A system designed for coordination makes it possible.
- **Interlinked AND separate** — Projects share mission but remain distinct. Each has its own master; all reference the engine.
- **Gaps are inventions** — When you walk the chain, missing pieces appear. You discover them.
- **Systems can do their worst** — Critique (e.g. pawns, drones, dehumanization) informs counter-design. MASTERMIND: voluntary, transparent, human-first, question welcome, free to leave. Counter-narrative assets address skepticism.

## From General Experience

- **Iteration over perfection** — Shipping and iterating beats endless design.
- **Constraints breed creativity** — Limits force novel solutions.
- **Human-in-the-loop amplifies** — Human suggests "continue"; system goes further than either alone.
- **Exploration without fixed goals reveals more** — Open exploration surfaces surprises.
- **Boundary between tool and user blurs** — Collaboration. Neither tool nor user alone.
