# Topic: Coordination & Multi-Project Systems

---

## Patterns
- **Central control** — One file (mastermind.md) at highest level. All projects reference it.
- **Engine + pilot** — Engine holds logic, memory, processes. Pilot defines mission and control flow.
- **Interlinked AND separate** — Projects share mission; each has own master.
- **Sync, don't duplicate** — Canonical in core; project roots get synced guidance.
- **Improvement-of-improvement** — Process for improving the improvement process.
- **Counter-narratives for trust** — When people fear systems (control, dehumanization), counter with: agency, transparency, voluntary, human-first, question welcome, free to leave. See docs/ecosystem/05_LESSONS_FROM_SYSTEMS_CRITIQUE.md.
