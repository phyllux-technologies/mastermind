# Topic: Instructions & Meta-Instructions

---

## Patterns
- **Project brain** — Single file (master.md) as source of truth. Read first, then execute.
- **5W1H** — Who, What, When, Where, Why, How. Use for alignment.
- **Totality check** — Brief pass before finishing.
- **Meta-instruction** — "When user says X, do Y." Enables evolution.
- **Preserve unless asked** — Don't change behavior without explicit request.
