# Learned Context — What AI Has Learned from the User

**Purpose:** Store what Cursor (or any AI using MASTERMIND) has learned from the user across sessions. Feeds into Continuous Learning & Insight Generation. Enables cross-session learning.

**Related:** main_memory.md, epiphanies.md, session_log.md, Learnings.md (workspace root when present), core/processes/continuous_learning_insight.md

## How to Use

1. **AI reads** this file when running Continuous Learning (every interaction).
2. **AI adds** to this file when something new is learned from the user — ideas, preferences, context, patterns.
3. **AI cross-references** user input with entries here to identify implications.

**When workspace has Learnings.md:** Prefer adding workspace-level learnings there. Use this file for MASTERMIND-specific or portable learnings (e.g., patterns that apply to any MASTERMIND user).

## Patterns (Recurring)

*When the same pattern appears repeatedly, note it here. These inform future insights.*
