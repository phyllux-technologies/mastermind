# MASTERMIND Core — The Engine

**Purpose:** The coordination engine. Memory, processes, projects, meta, sync.

## Structure

```
core/
├── memory/         ← Main Memory, epiphanies, session log
├── processes/      ← Improvement Propagation
├── projects/       ← Project registry, per-project coordination
├── meta/           ← Improvement-of-improvement
└── sync/           ← Templates
```

---

## Path Convention

All paths in core files use `core/` as the base. When MASTERMIND is at `workspace/mastermind/`, the core is at `workspace/mastermind/core/`. Adjust if your layout differs.
