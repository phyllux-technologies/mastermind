# MASTERMIND Coordination

When working on mastermind.md, mastermind/, or MASTERMIND_LINK.md, or when the user says "new idea", "improve the system", or "read mastermind":

1. **Read** mastermind.md first.
2. **For new idea:** Add to mastermind/core/memory/main_memory.md → run mastermind/core/processes/improvement_propagation.md.
3. **For improve the system:** Follow mastermind.md §4 — identify gaps, improve, document in core/CHANGELOG.md.
4. **Totality check** before finishing: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?
