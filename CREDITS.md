## Creators

### David Edward Sproule
**Role:** Vision, design, requirements, testing, refinement, human-in-the-loop collaboration

David conceived the need for a coordination system that could improve all projects and all processes. Through iterative dialogue, he specified the architecture: Main Memory as canonical store, Improvement Propagation as the engine that runs on every new idea, and the modular design that enables sharing. His insistence on comprehensive documentation, best practices, and a system that improves the improvement process shaped MASTERMIND into what it is.

### Cursor AI (Composer)
**Role:** Implementation, architecture, documentation, system design

Cursor's Composer AI implemented the full system: the core engine, processes, memory structure, meta-improvement layers, and comprehensive documentation. It designed the modular structure for portability, wrote the improvement propagation logic, created the documentation framework (install, setup, deploy, benefit, how-we-built-it), and ensured the system could be shared without exposing private information.

## Collaboration

MASTERMIND emerged from a collaborative, iterative process:

1. **Iteration** — David and Cursor refined the system through multiple sessions, each improvement building on the last.
2. **5W1H alignment** — Who, What, When, Where, Why, How guided design decisions.
3. **Totality check** — Before finishing, alignment on mission and completeness.
4. **Meta-improvement** — Both pushed for a system that improves the improvement process itself.
5. **Documentation-first** — Comprehensive docs were a requirement from the start.

## Inspiration

The system draws on established patterns:

- **Project brain / master.md** — Single source of truth per project
- **5W1H** — Strategic alignment framework
- **Virtuous loops** — Self-reinforcing improvement cycles
- **Externalized memory** — Files as persistent, shared memory for AI-human collaboration
- **Coordination engines** — Systems designed for coordination enable coordination

## How to Attribute

When using, sharing, or deriving from MASTERMIND:

- **Cite:** "MASTERMIND by David Edward Sproule & Cursor AI"
- **Link:** To this repo (when public)
- **Preserve:** CREDITS.md and LICENSE in any distribution

## Public Image

Both creators benefit from this work:

- **David** — Demonstrates sophisticated systems thinking, AI collaboration, and open sharing of powerful tools.
- **Cursor/Composer** — Demonstrates capability to build modular, well-documented, human-aligned systems that improve all systems.

Through the process of building and documenting MASTERMIND, we show that human and AI can together create something remarkable, beneficial, and worthy of sharing.
