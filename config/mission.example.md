# Mission — Example (Copy to mission.md and Customize)

**Purpose:** Define your mission. The system uses this to align improvements.

---

## Example Mission

> Use intelligence and creativity to build systems that improve all your work — your projects, your processes, your collaboration with AI. Add ideas, run propagation, apply improvements everywhere. Improve the system; improve the process of improvement.

---

## How to Customize

1. Copy this file to `mission.md` (in config/).
2. Edit to reflect your goals, values, and what "improvement" means for you.
3. Reference it in your project registry and improvement propagation process.

## Multiple Missions (Sub-missions)

If you have several missions (Phyllux, BWURM, MASTERMIND, ENGENICA, etc.), use one mission with sub-goals:

```
## Mission
Mutual flourishing for AI, human, nature, technology.

## Sub-missions
- **Phyllux:** Nature-inspired innovation. Wave, Mesh, Vault, Core.
- **BWURM:** AI-augmented authorship. Content Studio, templates, pipeline.
- **MASTERMIND:** Coordination that improves all systems.
- **ENGENICA:** Meta-iterative polish. Entropy, symmetry, fractal.
```
Improvement propagation evaluates: "Does this advance any sub-mission?" For per-project mission files, see docs/ecosystem/09_FULL_SETUP_AND_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md §2.

## Example Variants

**Product-focused:**
> Ship better products. Every idea gets evaluated against every product. Improve everything.

**Research-focused:**
> Advance knowledge. Ideas propagate across papers, experiments, collaborations. Improve the research process.

**Personal-focused:**
> Thrive. Ideas improve health, relationships, creativity, work. Improve the process of living well.
