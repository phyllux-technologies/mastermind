# Configuration — Example (Copy to config.md and Customize)

**Purpose:** Workspace paths and settings. Copy to `config.md` (or `local_config.md`) and customize.

---

## Workspace Root

The folder containing your projects. Examples:

- `your-workspace` or `workspace` (Windows: `C:\Users\You\Workspace`)
- `/Users/you/Workspace` (macOS/Linux)
- `.` (if mastermind is your workspace root)

---

## Project Paths

Relative to workspace root:

| Project | Path |
|---------|------|
| Project_A | projects/ProjectA |
| Project_B | projects/ProjectB |

---

## Core Path

Path to the MASTERMIND core (the engine). Usually:

- `mastermind/core` (if mastermind repo is at workspace/mastermind/)
- `./core` (if mastermind is workspace root)

---

## AI / Cursor

If using Cursor, add a rule at `.cursor/rules/mastermind.mdc` that instructs the AI to read mastermind.md when working on coordination or when you say "read mastermind" or "new idea."
