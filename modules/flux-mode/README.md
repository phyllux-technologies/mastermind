# MASTERMIND Flux (Flux Mode) — MASTERMIND Add-on

Adds process-centric Main Memory. Reality as flux. Entries evolve. Thread-aware propagation. Included-middle logic. Both/and over either/or. Avoid dialectic traps.

## Install

1. Add thread_id, flux_state to Main Memory. Copy propagation-questions.
2. Propagation threads: affect local and cross-system. Bifurcate, tunnel, oscillate.

---

## Use

Main Memory as **flux**, not fixed. **Threads** — propagation paths. **Included-middle** — both/and. Reduces over-rigid documentation. Richer conflict resolution.
