# Propagation Questions — MASTERMIND Care

| Target | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Each idea** | Are we giving this idea proper attention? (Care 1–5) |
| **Project** | Does this improvement preserve care for the thing, or rush past it? |
| **Mission** | Does care come first, or are we optimizing at the cost of attention? |
