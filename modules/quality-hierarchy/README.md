# Quality Hierarchy — MASTERMIND Add-on

Adds Pirsig's levels (inorganic → biological → social → intellectual) to propagation. Ensures improvements don't serve only lower levels. Prevents mission drift.

## Install

1. Copy `templates/propagation-questions.md` content into your `improvement_propagation.md` Step 2 (Evaluate) table.
2. Optionally: Add a `Level` column to Main Memory entries. Tag ideas: inorganic, biological, social, intellectual.

## Use

When evaluating an idea, ask: **"Which level of Static Quality does this serve?"**

- **Inorganic** — Physical, mechanical. Necessary but not sufficient.
- **Biological** — Life, health, survival.
- **Social** — Patterns, norms, relationships.
- **Intellectual** — Truth, beauty, understanding.
- **Mystic** — Dynamic Quality. The indefinable.

Avoid improvements that only serve inorganic or biological when higher levels are at stake. Align propagation with your mission's highest level.
