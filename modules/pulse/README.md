## Install

1. Copy `templates/propagation-questions.md` into Step 2 (Evaluate) of improvement_propagation.md.
2. Optionally: Add DQ/SQ column to Main Memory. Tag: DQ, SQ-temporary, SQ-exclusive.

## Use

When evaluating: **"Does this favor change (DQ) or stasis (SQ)? Is stasis temporary (good) or exclusive (bad)?"**

Avoid SQ-exclusive improvements. Prefer DQ when mission demands novelty.
