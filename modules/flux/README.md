# MASTERMIND Flux — Flux Mode

Main Memory as flux. Process-centric. Thread-aware propagation. Bifurcate, tunnel, oscillate. Included-middle logic.

*Attribution: Quantonics. Process philosophy.*

---

## Install

1. Adopt flux schema: entries evolve. No fixed objects.
2. Add thread semantics: local and cross-system.
3. Both/and over either/or in propagation.

---

## Use

- **Flux:** Main Memory entries evolve. Not static.
- **Threads:** Propagation threads affect local and cross-system. Bifurcate, tunnel, oscillate.
- **Middle:** Both/and. Avoid dialectic traps.
