# Workflows — Step-by-Step Guides

---

## Workflow 1: Starting a Project Task
1. Read mastermind.md.
2. Read core/projects/[PROJECT].md.
3. Read that project's master.
4. Execute. Update artifacts. Totality check.
5. If ideas emerged → add to main_memory → run propagation.

---

## Workflow 2: Adding a New Idea and Running Propagation
1. Add to core/memory/main_memory.md (New/Unprocessed if unsure).
2. Open core/processes/improvement_propagation.md.
3. Execute: Read → Evaluate → Apply → Propagate → Document → Totality check.
4. Move entry from New to appropriate section. Mark Status = propagated.

---

## Workflow 3: Improving the System
1. Read mastermind.md, core/meta/improvement_process.md.
2. Identify gaps, friction.
3. Improve mastermind, core, project links.
4. Document in core/CHANGELOG.md.
5. Totality check.

---

## Workflow 4: Improving Project Instructions
1. Revise project master, AGENTS, or rules.
2. Apply 5W1H; totality check.
3. Document in project CHANGELOG.
4. Preserve behavior unless asked.

---

## Workflow 5: Session End — Capture and Propagate
1. Add learnings to main_memory.
2. Add session summary to session_log.
3. Run propagation if new ideas.
4. Update main_memory; clear New/Unprocessed.
5. Totality check.

---

## Workflow 6: "Read mastermind" Then [Task]
1. Read mastermind.md fully.
2. Apply context to the task.
3. Execute.
4. Update CHANGELOG/BUGS as needed.
5. Totality check.

---

## Workflow 7: Addressing Skepticism ("Is this another controlling system?")
1. Point to 09_FAQ — "Is MASTERMIND another controlling system?"
2. Share counter-narrative: voluntary, transparent, human-first, free to leave.
3. Reference docs/ecosystem/05_LESSONS_FROM_SYSTEMS_CRITIQUE.md (images, principles).
4. Emphasize: You choose. The system serves you.

---

## Workflow 8: Preparing for Public Release
1. Run `mm check` — structure validated.
2. Complete REPO_SETUP.md — sanitize paths, names; review for private content.
3. Complete 03_DEPLOYMENT Rollout Checklist (LICENSE, CREDITS, README, docs, assets).
4. Create GitHub repo. Push. Add topics: productivity, ai, coordination, workflow.
5. Optional: See docs/ecosystem/07_ROLLOUT_AND_WEB_ECOSYSTEM_STRATEGY.md for web integration.
