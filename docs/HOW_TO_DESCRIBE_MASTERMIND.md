# How to Describe MASTERMIND — To Anyone

**Purpose:** Ready-to-use language for introducing, explaining, or selling MASTERMIND. Pick the right one for your audience and situation.

---

## One-Liners (Pick One)

- **"A coordination system that improves all your systems."**
- **"One place for ideas. One process. Every project gets better."**
- **"Main Memory + Improvement Propagation — your ideas don't get lost, they propagate."**
- **"It's like a shared brain between you and AI that actually improves your work across all projects."**
- **"Add an idea. Run it. The system evaluates it against every project. Improvements spread. Nothing falls through the cracks."**

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

> "MASTERMIND is a coordination system. You add ideas to something called Main Memory. Then you run Improvement Propagation — it evaluates every idea against all your projects. If the idea fits Project A, you apply it. If it fits Project B too, you propagate it. One lesson becomes many improvements. And the system improves itself — when you say 'improve the improvement process,' it gets better. Free core. Optional modules. Voluntary. Transparent. You're in control."

---

## For Technical People

> "File-based coordination engine. Main Memory is a markdown table. Improvement Propagation is a process doc. You run it when you add an idea — evaluate against each project, apply where it fits, propagate to others. CLI: `mm add`, `mm propagate`, `mm check`. No servers. No lock-in. Integrates with Cursor, VS Code, Git. Open source."

---

## For Non-Technical People

> "Imagine one notebook where every good idea goes. And a simple process: whenever you add something, you ask 'Does this help Project A? Project B?' If yes, you use it there too. Over time, everything improves because nothing gets forgotten. MASTERMIND is that system — but it's built so you can actually *do* it, not just intend to. Free to try. You stay in charge."

---

## For Skeptics ("Another productivity system?")

> "It's not a to-do list or a project manager. It's a *coordination* system — one place that connects your projects and makes sure learnings spread. And it's voluntary. Transparent. You can leave anytime. The goal isn't to control you — it's to help your ideas actually land in the right places. Try the free core. See if it helps. No commitment."

**If they say "sounds like another system that will own my workflow":**
> "That's a fair concern. MASTERMIND is designed the opposite way: you choose what to add. You run the process when you want. No compliance. No guilt. And we have counter-narratives built in — agency, transparency, question-welcome. The system serves you, not the other way around."

---

## For Selling (Modules, Value Prop)

> "MASTERMIND is free to use. The core — Main Memory, propagation, coordination — is open. What we sell are *modules*: add-ons that plug in. Quality Hierarchy from Pirsig. ENGENICA Polish. Lexical Chain for concept extraction. Each module adds a specific way of thinking or a capability. You buy only what improves your system. One concept at a time. No bloat."

**When they ask "why should I pay?":**
> "The free core gets you coordination. The modules get you frameworks — Pirsig's Quality Hierarchy, Quantonics DQ/SQ, tacit knowledge capture from Polanyi — that change *how* you evaluate ideas. If you want that lens, the module delivers it. If you're good with the core, stay free. Your call."

---

## For Partners / "Join the Action"

> "We're building an ecosystem — MASTERMIND, Phyllux, ENGENICA, modules. We want partners. Affiliates who promote and earn commission. Resellers who sell to teams. Integration partners who connect MASTERMIND to their tools. Module creators who build add-ons and share revenue. It's mutually beneficial. Transparent. If you want to be part of it, we're open."

## By Situation

| Situation | What to Say |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Casual intro** | "It's a system that helps ideas propagate across all your projects. Add something once, it gets evaluated everywhere. Nothing gets lost." |
| **Someone lost and scattered** | "You have lots of ideas and lots of projects. MASTERMIND gives you one place to put ideas and one process to make sure they land where they matter." |
| **Someone skeptical of "systems"** | "It's voluntary. Transparent. You're in control. No compliance. The system serves you. We built it that way on purpose." |
| **Technical friend** | "File-based. Markdown. CLI. No servers. Improvement propagation as a process. Integrates with Cursor and your workflow." |
| **Potential buyer of modules** | "Free core. Premium modules add specific frameworks — Quality Hierarchy, ENGENICA polish, etc. You pay for what improves you. One at a time." |
| **Potential partner** | "We're open to affiliates, resellers, integrators. Revenue share. Cross-promotion. Mutually beneficial. Want in?" |
| **"What's the catch?"** | "No catch. Free core. Optional paid modules. You decide. We made it transparent and voluntary because we don't want a system that controls people." |

## Key Phrases to Use

- **"Ideas don't get lost"** — Main value prop.
- **"One lesson, many improvements"** — Propagation benefit.
- **"The system improves itself"** — Meta-improvement.
- **"You choose. The system serves you."** — Agency, anti-control.
- **"Voluntary. Transparent. Free to leave."** — Trust.
- **"Mutual flourishing"** — Mission.

---

## Key Phrases to Avoid (Unless Asked)

- Don't lead with "coordination engine" — too jargon-y for some.
- Don't say "it's like a second brain" unless they know BASB — can confuse.
- Don't oversell "AI" — it's file-based; AI reads the files. Keep it simple.
