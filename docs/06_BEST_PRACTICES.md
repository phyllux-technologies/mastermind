# Best Practices — Using MASTERMIND Optimally

---

1. **Always read mastermind first** — Context before action.
2. **Add ideas immediately; run propagation right after** — Don't let ideas sit in New/Unprocessed.
3. **Use New/Unprocessed correctly** — Queue, not storage. Keep it empty or nearly empty.
4. **Document every improvement** — CHANGELOG, session_log, main_memory. Traceability.
5. **Run totality check before finishing** — Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?
6. **Preserve unless asked** — Don't change behavior without explicit rationale.
7. **Propagate improvements across projects** — One lesson → many applications.
8. **Keep Main Memory and epiphanies in sync** — Significant epiphanies go in both.
9. **Use 5W1H for alignment** — When planning, improving, evaluating.
10. **Improve the improvement process** — When friction appears, refine meta/.
11. **Mission alignment** — Only apply improvements that advance your mission.
12. **Session bookends** — Start: read mastermind. End: add learnings, run propagation.
13. **One propagation cycle per trigger** — Unless user requests continued propagation.
14. **Reference the docs** — INDEX, Reference, Workflows when unsure.
15. **Voluntary participation** — MASTERMIND serves you. Question it, critique it, adapt it. No blind compliance. See docs/ecosystem/05_LESSONS_FROM_SYSTEMS_CRITIQUE.md.
16. **Dogfood before publish** — Use MASTERMIND on itself. Add ideas, run propagation, run `mm check`. See docs/ecosystem/06_IMPROVEMENT_IN_USE.md. Value assessment before public release.
17. **Publish path** — Run `mm check`, REPO_SETUP sanitization, 03_DEPLOYMENT Rollout Checklist. See 07_WORKFLOWS §8, 09_FAQ.
