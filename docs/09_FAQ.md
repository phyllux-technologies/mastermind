# FAQ — Common Questions

---

**Where do I add a new idea?**  
core/memory/main_memory.md. Use New/Unprocessed if unsure. Then run propagation.

**When do I run propagation?**  
Every time you add a new idea. Or when you say "run propagation" or "check main memory."

**What if propagation finds no improvements?**  
That's valid. Document the run. Move the idea to the right section. Mark Status = "evaluated, no changes needed."

**How do I know which project an idea affects?**  
Use the evaluation table in improvement_propagation.md. For each project, ask the question. If "yes" → it affects that project.

**The AI isn't following the process.**  
Explicitly say: "Read mastermind.md and core/processes/improvement_propagation.md, then [request]." Or add a Cursor rule (see 02_SETUP).

**I added an idea but nothing happened.**  
Did you run the Improvement Propagation Process? Adding to main_memory doesn't auto-run it. You must run the process.

**How do I add a new project?**  
1. Add to core/projects/_registry.md. 2. Create core/projects/[PROJECT].md (use _template.md). 3. Add MASTERMIND_LINK.md to project root.

**Is MASTERMIND another controlling system?**  
No. MASTERMIND is voluntary, transparent, human-centered. You choose. Free to use, free to leave. No compliance required. Question it, critique it, adapt it. See docs/ecosystem/05_LESSONS_FROM_SYSTEMS_CRITIQUE.md for counter-narrative assets and principles.

**Where do I start?**  
docs/INDEX.md or 01_INSTALLATION.md.

**I need a quick lookup.**  
docs/08_REFERENCE.md.

**When should I publish MASTERMIND?**  
When you've used it yourself, run `mm check`, and completed REPO_SETUP + 03_DEPLOYMENT Rollout Checklist. See docs/ecosystem/06_IMPROVEMENT_IN_USE.md (dogfood first).

**How do I prepare the repo for public?**  
REPO_SETUP.md. Sanitize: replace workspace-specific paths, project names. 03_DEPLOYMENT Rollout Checklist. Run `mm check` before push.

**Where do I find the rollout checklist?**  
docs/03_DEPLOYMENT.md (Rollout Checklist). docs/ecosystem/07_ROLLOUT_AND_WEB_ECOSYSTEM_STRATEGY.md (your steps, web/repo options).
