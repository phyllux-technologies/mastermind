# System for MASTERMIND-Caliber Products

**Purpose:** Document and refine the process that created MASTERMIND — so it can create more products of the same caliber. From inception to final rollout. Using Cursor (or similar) the way you do. Education and refinement as we go.

**Vision:** A repeatable system that generates ideas and products that are:
- Mission-aligned (mutual flourishing)
- Well-documented
- Coordinated (MASTERMIND, 888, projects)
- Ready for public release
- Improved by use (dogfooding)

---

## What We Did to Create MASTERMIND

### Inception
- User had a coordination need (projects, memory, propagation)
- mind.md, canon.md, BWURM sessions → epiphanies (5W1H, improvement process, totality check)
- "Store learnings in mastermind.md" → 888 coordination engine design

### Creation
- 888/ created: memory/, projects/, sync/, meta/, processes/
- mastermind.md at workspace root as pilot
- Improvement propagation process
- CLI (mm add, propagate, check, sync-links, scan, status)

### Modularization
- mastermind/ created: core/, config/, templates/, docs/, assets/
- Generic, shareable. No private paths. Repo-ready.

### Ecosystem
- docs/ecosystem/: strategy, Governor, sellable modules, systems critique
- 74+ images. Counter-narrative. ENGENICA, Lexical Chain integration.

### Refinement
- Cross-pollination (888 ↔ mastermind)
- Master Scrutiny. Improvement in Use. Value assessment.

## The Meta-System: From Idea to Launch

### Stage 1: Idea
- **Input:** Problem, need, or epiphany
- **Action:** Add to Main Memory. Run propagation. Evaluate against all projects.
- **Output:** Validated idea. Propagation applied. Lessons captured.

### Stage 2: Design
- **Input:** Validated idea
- **Action:** Design structure (like 888: memory/, projects/, sync/). Document in mind.md or project doc. Get AI (Cursor) to help.
- **Output:** Design doc. Structure. Conventions.

### Stage 3: Build
- **Input:** Design
- **Action:** Create folders, files, processes. Use Cursor. Iterate. "Continue." Document as you go.
- **Output:** Working system. CHANGELOG. session_log.

### Stage 4: Modularize (If Sharing)
- **Input:** Working system
- **Action:** Extract generic core. Remove private data. Add docs, templates, examples. Create shareable repo structure.
- **Output:** Repo-ready package. Installation doc. Rollout checklist.

### Stage 5: Ecosystem (If Product)
- **Input:** Repo-ready package
- **Action:** Strategy, modules, Governor (if needed), marketing assets, counter-narrative. Integrate with existing projects.
- **Output:** Full product. Docs. Images. Sellable modules (if applicable).

### Stage 6: Dogfood & Refine
- **Input:** Full product
- **Action:** Use it. Improvement in Use. Value assessment. Fix friction. Propagate learnings.
- **Output:** Polished system. Verified value.

### Stage 7: Rollout
- **Input:** Polished system
- **Action:** Rollout checklist. Create repo. Push. Public. Link from hub. Netlify or static host if needed.
- **Output:** Live product. Public. Discoverable.

### Stage 8: Integrate & Evolve
- **Input:** Live product
- **Action:** Add to project registry. Cross-pollinate. Improve. New ideas → Main Memory → propagation.
- **Output:** Living system. Part of ecosystem.

## Cursor / AI Workflow (How You Do It)

### Pattern
1. **Read mastermind** — AI reads mastermind.md, 888, context
2. **Task** — You give a task: "improve the system," "add idea," "continue"
3. **Execute** — AI executes. Uses tools. Edits files. Runs commands.
4. **Continue** — You say "continue." AI keeps going. Iteration.
5. **Document** — Every change in CHANGELOG, session_log. Traceability.

### Education as You Go
- **When AI does something well:** Note it. Add to epiphanies or best practices.
- **When something breaks:** Fix. Document. Add to lessons learned.
- **When you learn:** Add to Main Memory. Run propagation. Share with projects.

### Refinements
- **Cursor rules** — .cursor/rules/mastermind.mdc. Triggers, context.
- **AGENTS.md** — Project-level AI instructions.
- **master.md** — Single source of truth per project. Read first.
- **Improvement process** — Recursive. Improves itself when asked.

- [ ] CLI or automation if it helps (mm-style)
- [ ] Documentation: install, setup, deploy, benefit
- [ ] CHANGELOG and session_log maintained

## Mutual Flourishing as North Star

> Use intelligence, creativity, and technology to build systems that increase mutual flourishing between humans, nature, and sentient AI, with integrity and respect for all beings.

**Every product we make** should answer: Does this increase flourishing? For whom? How?

MASTERMIND: Coordination → less chaos → more capacity to create → flourishing.  
Phyllux: Nature-inspired tech → new capabilities → flourishing.  
BWURM: AI augments authorship → creative expression → flourishing.  
ENGENICA: Polish, quality → better artifacts → flourishing.

**The system that generates these products** — this meta-system — is itself a path toward utopia: repeatable creation of value, aligned with mission, improved by use.
